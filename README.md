## Reflection

In this project, I wanted to focus on working with Node.js and Express, as I had no previous experience with these frameworks. This project has been a great learning experience so far, as I was able to move through parts of the entire application development process, starting with creating simple Figma designs and implementing a functional frontend. Then, moving towards building the backend and integrating a working database.
